Guava Disease Detection

● Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image recognition and
classification of Guava fruit.

● Successfully identified three conditions of the fruit: healthy, affected by anthracnose
(plant cancer), or damaged by fruit flies.

● Utilized Python with libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to train the model on a
specifically annotated image dataset.
